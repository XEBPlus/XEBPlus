<p align="center"><b><font face="Calibri" size="5">About XtremeEliteBoot+:</font><font face="Calibri"><br>
<font size="2">&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Calibri" size="5"><br>
</font><font face="Calibri">"XtremeEliteBoot" (XEB) was a project started in 
2012 by "Howling Wolf Naru-José" and "Chelsea_Fantasy"<br>
(aka: "Howling Wolf &amp; Chelsea"). It is intended to be a "ready to use", "all-in-one", 
"noob-proof" alternative<br>
to "FreeMcBoot". Also, XEB featured some exclusive features that no PS2 homebrew 
was able to provide<br>
until the time of writing this (2017-11-15).<br>
<br>
The original XEB never was released on the internet, but it was distributed in 
Cuba on a very small circle of people.<br>
A companion PC tool for XEB named "USB Installer" (specifically the 3.x versions) 
was released on the internet on 2013,<br>
but only for the web www.scenespain.net and once that web closed three years 
ago, the software kinda dissapear from<br>
the public eyes. Anyway, it was re-uploaded by a PS2-Home user on November 2016.<br>
If you compare both GUIS, you will found they share the background and affects:<br>

<br>
Now, on 2017, we (Howling Wolf &amp; Chelsea), want to bring XEB back and finally 
publish it on the web.<br>
We want to make an upgraded version of the original XEB, named XEB+ (a very 
original name for an<br>
upgraded version)... Anyway, we need some help from the PS2 sceners worldwide (read 
bellow for details).<br>
We think we can release it around 2018/01 or 2018/02. We already coded the new 
interface and functions<br>
(in other words, everything running on the PS2 side), the only thing left to 
code are the companion<br>
PC tools for the XEB+ exclusive features and game launchers. For the curious, 
just take a look at the<br>
new interface (we made some censorship on the picture to hide some stuff):<br>
<br>

<br>
We will not say a word about what are the XEB+ exclusive features, not even a 
hint.<br>
<br>
We hope you look forward for the release of XtremeEliteBoot+ on 2018.<br>

translators. We have plans of releasing XEB+ on at least "Spanish" and "English", 
but we also have our doors<br>
